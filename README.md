Basic GNS3 network lab with routers, switch, and PCs.
# GNS3 Network Lab

This is a basic GNS3 network lab using two Cisco 2600 routers, one switch, and multiple PCs. The lab is designed to help beginners understand how to configure IP addresses, set up routing, and test connectivity between network devices.

## 🧩 Topology
- 2 Routers (R1, R2)
- 1 Switch
- 3 PCs 

## ⚙️ Features
- IP addressing
- Direct connection between routers using a serial or Ethernet link
- Default gateway configuration for PCs
- Static routing 
- Ping tests between devices

## 📁 Files Included
- job1.gns3: GNS3 project file
- router-config.txt: Router configuration commands
- pc-config.txt: Manual PC setup via console
- README.md: Project documentation

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the `.gns3` project file in GNS3.
2. Power on all devices.
3. Open the console for each pc to apply the saved configurations .
4. Use `ping` to test connectivity between PCs and routers.

## 🧠 Notes
- Make sure each PC has its correct IP and default gateway.
- Routers must be in the same subnet for direct connection unless routing is configured.
